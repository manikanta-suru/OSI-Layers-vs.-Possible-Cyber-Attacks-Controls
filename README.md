The comparison between the OSI layers, potential cyber attacks, and corresponding attack controls is a crucial aspect of securing digital information. Understanding the different layers of the OSI model and the potential vulnerabilities at each layer is essential for implementing effective security measures. By identifying possible cyber attacks that can occur at each layer, appropriate attack controls can be put in place to mitigate or prevent such attacks. It is essential to have a comprehensive understanding of these concepts to ensure the safety and security of digital systems.
